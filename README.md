# automatic-snail-feeder

This automatic snail feeder reminds students to feed the snails in our lab.
The snails need to be fed 2 algae pellets roughly every 4 days. 
Fish feeders on the market don't generally work with algae thins and typically only schedule times during the day, not every few days. 

I created a rotating revolver system on a servo. Every 4 days, the servo rotates, dropping in algae pellets into the water. 
Once the entire revolver is empty, the light illuminates and reminds students to refill the revolver with algae thins.
